ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nianzu Yang!

I'm a Ph.D student @SJTU-ThinkLab, supervised by [Prof. Junchi Yan](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn/).


About me
======
I am pursuing my PhD degree at Department of Computer Science in School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), Shanghai. Before that, I earned bachelor degree in IEEE Honor class at SJTU. I major in Computer Science and my **research interests** include recommender systems, molecule generation and optimization, out-of-distribution generalization and graph neural networks.
